# DDD-CQRS-Boilerplate

DDD-CQRS-Boilerplate is a comprehensive boilerplate for kickstarting domain-driven design (DDD) web API projects using the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern in .NET Core. This repository serves as a foundation to quickly build scalable and maintainable applications following industry best practices.

## Key Features

- **CQRS Architecture**: The repository is structured around the CQRS pattern, separating read and write concerns, enabling a clear separation of responsibilities, and promoting better scalability and flexibility.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The boilerplate embraces the principles of DDD, allowing you to focus on modeling your domain and capturing business logic effectively.
- **Web API**: The repository provides a well-defined API layer that supports RESTful endpoints, facilitating easy integration and communication with client applications.
- **Persistence**: It includes an extensible data persistence layer, allowing you to integrate with various database technologies such as SQL databases or NoSQL solutions.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leveraging the power of .NET Core's built-in dependency injection container, the boilerplate encourages loose coupling and testability.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: The repository offers a flexible authentication and authorization setup, supporting popular authentication schemes such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.
